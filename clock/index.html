      Like a lot of people, I am not sleeping as well as I was a few months ago.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      I am still able to nod off fairly easily, and unlike many, my sleep is not often broken with fits of staring anxiously at the ceiling. I am, however, waking up much earlier, well before dawn. 
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph"> 
      I live in a very quiet suburb at the best of times – the nearest train line and major highway half an hour’s walk away. But lately, in the pre-dawn darkness, the world outside my window is as still as death: no car engines warming up in commuters’ driveways, no pounding footfall of joggers on a pre-work run. All is unnervingly silent, as if the world is broken and I am alone with my dark thoughts.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      But then I hear those first, welcome notes. Some mornings it’s the comforting soft carolling of the Australian magpie, others it’s the repetitive, urgent piping of gangs of noisy miners. Soon they will be joined by the silvery song of the grey butcherbird, the smaller cousin of the magpie whose large beak tricks people into thinking they are baby kookaburras. The local pied currawongs might chip in with their evocative chimes resonating in the stillness. The screech of rainbow lorikeets hurtling towards their morning feast of nectar from the neighbourhood flowering gums punctuate the air.
