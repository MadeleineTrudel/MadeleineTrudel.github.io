      In our noisy, industrial society, birdsong has largely been drowned out, all too easy to ignore. However, in the quietude of lockdown and isolation many of us have once again become attuned to their sound breaking the silence. BirdLife Australia has been inundated with people wanting to share or have identified the birds who have been visiting their garden.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      One Melbourne birdwatcher started an online movement, #birdthefeckathome which encourages people to record birds they have seen in their backyards. Since launching at the end of March, the site has logged over 2,600 species – around a quarter of the world’s birds. In the radio talkback segments I’ve been doing, callers are freaking out that the birds “were going crazy” but almost all the behaviours described were fairly standard for Australian birds who are a gregarious and outlandish lot.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph"> 
      The difference is, confined to our homes all day, surrounded by a quiet most of us have never experienced, we are noticing for the first time the daily soap operas of the feathered characters we share our surrounds with. Even in the high-rise midst of our city centres people are noticing cockatoos, currawongs and pigeons living pretty much as they did before the virus.
